Class Exercise #5

Name: Rayner Kristanto

Describe any challenges you faced as well as any extra polish you applied (for the extra points):

Challenge 
I created a button with the following line of code:

	Stop = p5.addButton(“stop”).setLabel(“Stop”);
	
When I pressed this button in the window, the window would freeze, and I would have to close it. However, when I tried clicking other buttons, the problem did not happen. I replaced the above code with 
	
	s = p5.addButton(“s”).setLabel(“Stop”); 

and the button worked fine.

Polish
Every time a button is pressed, a click sound is played. This click sound goes through the Glide UGen which randomly sets the rate of the sound for the next time it is played.
